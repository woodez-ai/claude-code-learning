# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a learning repository for creating a diago reset api

## Repository Structure

- Currently contains only basic setup files (README.md, .gitignore)
- This is a django rest-api project
- No build tools, dependencies, or application code present yet

## Development Environment

- No package managers or dependency files detected
- No testing framework configured
- No linting or formatting tools configured
- create a python environment and install all dep in that.
- Repository uses Git for version control

## Notes for Future Development

This appears to be a fresh learning repository. Future Claude Code instances should expect to:
- Help establish project structure and tooling as needed
- Follow standard Python conventions if Python development begins
- Set up appropriate build, test, and development workflows when the project direction becomes clear
