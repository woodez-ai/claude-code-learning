# Logo Assets Guide

## Current Implementation
The Woodezfi logo is currently implemented as an animated CSS-based component with the following features:
- Gradient text effect that shifts colors
- Letter-by-letter bounce animation
- Hover effects
- Responsive sizing
- GIF-like animation effects

## To Add Real Logo Assets

### 1. Create Logo Files
You'll need to create the following logo files and place them in the `/public` folder:

- `woodezfi-logo.gif` - Main animated logo GIF
- `woodezfi-logo.png` - Static PNG version
- `favicon.ico` - 32x32 favicon
- `logo192.png` - 192x192 for mobile
- `logo512.png` - 512x512 for mobile

### 2. Logo Design Suggestions
For creating the actual Woodezfi logo GIF, consider:

**Style Elements:**
- Modern, clean typography
- Financial/investment theme colors (blues, greens, purples)
- Professional yet approachable
- Animation that conveys growth/progress

**Animation Ideas:**
- Letters appearing one by one
- Gradient color shifts
- Subtle pulsing or breathing effect
- Arrow or chart elements that animate

### 3. Tools for Creating Logo GIF
- **Canva** - Easy online tool with animation features
- **Adobe After Effects** - Professional animation tool
- **Figma + Figma to GIF plugins** - Design in Figma, export as GIF
- **GIMP** - Free alternative with animation capabilities

### 4. Update Implementation
Once you have the logo assets:

1. Replace the current CSS-based Logo component with:
```jsx
const Logo = ({ size = 'medium', className = '' }) => {
  const sizeClasses = {
    small: 'h-8',
    medium: 'h-12', 
    large: 'h-16',
    xlarge: 'h-24'
  };

  return (
    <img 
      src="/woodezfi-logo.gif" 
      alt="Woodezfi" 
      className={`${sizeClasses[size]} ${className}`}
    />
  );
};
```

2. Update favicon and app icons in `public/` folder
3. Update manifest.json to reference new icon files

### 5. Brand Colors Used
The current CSS implementation uses these colors that work well for the brand:
- Primary gradient: `#667eea` to `#764ba2`
- Theme color: `#667eea`
- Background: `#ffffff`

These colors create a professional, tech-forward appearance suitable for a financial application.
